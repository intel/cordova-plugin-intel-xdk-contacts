intel.xdk.contacts
==================

For access to the on-device contacts database.

Description
-----------

The contacts plugin gives programmers access to the default contacts database on
the native device. The application must be built with appropriate permissions in
order for this capability to work.

### Contact Objects

The plugin vends “contact objects” which represent entries in the native
contacts database. Each contact object has the following properties:

-   **id:** An identifier which is unique to this contact, and which can be used
    to refer to it in plugin method calls. It may be either a number or a
    string, depending on the platform.
-   **last:** A string containing the last name of the person.
-   **first:** A string containing the first name of the person.
-   **name:** A string containing the entire name of the person. (Not
    necessarily just the concatenation of the first and last names.)
-   **emails:** An array of strings containing email addresses.
-   **phones:** An array of strings containing phone numbers.
-   **addresses:**  An array of objects representing addresses.

An address object has the following properties:

-   **street:** A string containing the street address. (May contain multiple
    lines separated by line-feed characters.)
-   **city:** A string containing the city name.
-   **state:** A string containing a state or province name or abbreviation.
-   **zip:** A string containing a zip or postal code.
-   **country:** A string containing a country name or abbreviation.

### The Internal Contact List

The plugin keeps an internal contact list, which is a cached copy of the device
contacts database. The internal contact list is _not_ initialized automatically,
and a call to [getContactList](#getcontactlist) or
[getContactData](#getcontactdata) will return `null` if it has not been
initialized.

The internal contact list may be explicitly initialized by a call to
[getContacts](#getcontacts), or implicitly initialized or updated by a
successful call to [addContact](#addcontact), [chooseContact](#choosecontact),
[editContact](#editcontact), or [removeContact](#removecontact).

Note that a change to the device contacts database made other than through the
plugin will not be reflected in the internal contact list until it is
initialized or updated.

### Methods

Note that methods that access or manipulate the contacts database may present
the platform native interface for that functionality.

-   [addContact](#addcontact) — Allow the user to add a contact.
-   [chooseContact](#choosecontact) — Allow the user to choose a contact.
-   [editContact](#editcontact) — Allow the user to edit a contact.
-   [getContactData](#getcontactdata) — Return the contact object with a
    particular identifier.
-   [getContactList](#getcontactlist) — Return an array of the identifiers of
    all contacts in the database.
-   [getContacts](#getcontacts) — Fetch the device contact database into the
    plugin.
-   [removeContact](#removecontact) — Remove a specified contact.

### Events

-   [intel.xdk.contacts.add](#add) — The user has added a contact.
-   [intel.xdk.contacts.busy](#busy) — An operation was requested when another
    operation was already in progress.
-   [intel.xdk.contacts.choose](#choose) — The user has selected a contact.
-   [intel.xdk.contacts.edit](#edit) — The user has finished editing a contact.
-   [intel.xdk.contacts.get](#get) — The device contact database has been
    fetched into the plugin.
-   [intel.xdk.contacts.remove](#remove) — A contact has been removed.

Methods
-------

### addContact

Invokes the system “add contact” dialog.

```javascript
intel.xdk.contacts.addContact();
```

#### Description

This method displays the native device’s UI to allow the user to add a new
contact.

#### Platforms

-   Apple iOS
-   Google Android

#### Events

-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.permissionDenied](#permissiondenied):** The
    application does not have permission to access the system contacts database.
-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.busy](#busy):** Some other contacts action has been
    initiated and is not yet complete.
-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.add(_success_, _contactid_)](#add):** If _success_ is
    `true`, then the user added a new contact whose id is _contactid_. If
    _success_ is `false`, the user cancelled the dialog, and _contactid_ is
    undefined.

>   **Note:** If [the internal contact list](#the-internal-contact-list) was
>   uninitialized before the call and the user canceled the add operation (i.e.,
>   _success_ was `false`), then the internal contact list is still
>   uninitialized.

#### Example

}
```

### getContacts

Initialize the plugin [internal contact list](#the-internal-contact-list) from the
device contacts database.

```javascript
intel.xdk.contacts.getContacts();
```

#### Description

This plugin maintains an [internal copy](#the-internal-contact-list) of the device
contacts database. The [getContactList](#getcontactlist) and
[getContactData](#getcontactdata) methods retrieve information from the internal
contact list, not directly from the device database. Therefore, the internal
copy must be initialized from the system database before
[getContactList](#getcontactlist) or [getContactData](#getcontactdata) is
called. That initialization can occur explicitly with a call to this method, or
implicitly with a successful call to [addContact](#addcontact),
[removeContact](#removecontact), [chooseContact](#choosecontact), or
[editContact](#editcontact).

#### Available Platforms

-   Apple iOS
-   Google Android
-   Microsoft Windows 8 - BETA
-   Microsoft Windows Phone 8 - BETA

#### Events

-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.permissionDenied](#permissiondenied):** The
    application does not have permission to access the system contacts database.
    The internal list has not been initialized.
-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.get(_success_)](#get):** The internal contact list has
    been initialized. _success_ will always be true.

#### Example

```javascript

document.addEventListener('intel.xdk.contacts.get', contactsReceived, false);

intel.xdk.contacts.getContacts();

```

### removeContact

Remove a contact.

```javascript
intel.xdk.contacts.removeContact(contactID);
```

#### Description

This method removes a specified contact.

#### Platforms

-   Apple iOS
-   Google Android

#### Parameters

-   **contactID:** The contact ID of the contact to remove

#### Events

-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.permissionDenied](#permissiondenied):** The
    application does not have permission to access the system contacts database.
-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.busy](#busy):** Some other contacts action has been
    initiated and is not yet complete.
-   **[intel.xdk.contacts.remove(_success_, _contactid_, _error_)](#choose):**
    If _success_ is `true`, then the contact whose id is _contactid_ has been
    removed. If _success_ is `false`, the contacts database has not been
    changed, and _error_ is a string describing the reason the contact was not
    removed.

>   **Note:** If [the internal contact list](#the-internal-contact-list) was
>   uninitialized before the call and the remove operation failed for any reason
>   (i.e., _success_ was `false`), then the internal contact list is still
>   uninitialized.


#### Example

```javascript
document.addEventListener('intel.xdk.contacts.remove', onContactRemoved);

intel.xdk.contacts.removeContact(contactID);

function onEditContact(evt) {
   if (evt.success == true)
   {
      alert("Contact "+evt.contactid+" has been removed");
   }
